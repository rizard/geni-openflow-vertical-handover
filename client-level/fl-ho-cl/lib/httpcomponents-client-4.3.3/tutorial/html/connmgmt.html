        <p>The process of establishing a connection from one host to another is quite complex and
            involves multiple packet exchanges between two endpoints, which can be quite time
            consuming. The overhead of connection handshaking can be significant, especially for
            small HTTP messages. One can achieve a much higher data throughput if open connections
            can be re-used to execute multiple requests.</p>
        <p>HTTP/1.1 states that HTTP connections can be re-used for multiple requests per
            default. HTTP/1.0 compliant endpoints can also use a mechanism to explicitly
            communicate their preference to keep connection alive and use it for multiple requests.
            HTTP agents can also keep idle connections alive for a certain period time in case a
            connection to the same target host is needed for subsequent requests. The ability to
            keep connections alive is usually refered to as connection persistence. HttpClient fully
            supports connection persistence.</p>

        <p>HttpClient is capable of establishing connections to the target host either directly
            or via a route that may involve multiple intermediate connections - also referred to as
            hops. HttpClient differentiates connections of a route into plain, tunneled and layered.
            The use of multiple intermediate proxies to tunnel connections to the target host is
            referred to as proxy chaining.</p>
        <p>Plain routes are established by connecting to the target or the first and only proxy.
            Tunnelled routes are established by connecting to the first and tunnelling through a
            chain of proxies to the target. Routes without a proxy cannot be tunnelled. Layered
            routes are established by layering a protocol over an existing connection. Protocols can
            only be layered over a tunnel to the target, or over a direct connection without
            proxies.</p>

            <p>The <code class="interfacename">RouteInfo</code> interface represents information
                about a definitive route to a target host involving one or more intermediate steps
                or hops. <code class="classname">HttpRoute</code> is a concrete implementation of
                the <code class="interfacename">RouteInfo</code>, which cannot be changed (is
                immutable). <code class="classname">HttpTracker</code> is a mutable
                <code class="interfacename">RouteInfo</code> implementation used internally by
                HttpClient to track the remaining hops to the ultimate route target.
                <code class="classname">HttpTracker</code> can be updated after a successful execution
                of the next hop towards the route target. <code class="classname">HttpRouteDirector</code>
                is a helper class that can be used to compute the next step in a route. This class
                is used internally by HttpClient.</p>
            <p><code class="interfacename">HttpRoutePlanner</code> is an interface representing a
                strategy to compute a complete route to a given target based on the execution
                context. HttpClient ships with two default
                <code class="interfacename">HttpRoutePlanner</code> implementations.
                <code class="classname">SystemDefaultRoutePlanner</code> is based on
                <code class="classname">java.net.ProxySelector</code>. By default, it will pick up the
                proxy settings of the JVM, either from system properties or from the browser running
                the application. The <code class="classname">DefaultProxyRoutePlanner</code> implementation
                does not make use of any Java system properties, nor any system or browser proxy
                settings. It always computes routes via the same default proxy.</p>

            <p>HTTP connections can be considered secure if information transmitted between two
                connection endpoints cannot be read or tampered with by an unauthorized third party.
                The SSL/TLS protocol is the most widely used technique to ensure HTTP transport
                security. However, other encryption techniques could be employed as well. Usually,
                HTTP transport is layered over the SSL/TLS encrypted connection.</p>

        <div class="section" title="2.3.1.&nbsp;Managed connections and connection managers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e363"></a>2.3.1.&nbsp;Managed connections and connection managers</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>HTTP connections are complex, stateful, thread-unsafe objects which need to be
                properly managed to function correctly. HTTP connections can only be used by one
                execution thread at a time. HttpClient employs a special entity to manage access to
                HTTP connections called HTTP connection manager and represented by the
                <code class="interfacename">HttpClientConnectionManager</code> interface. The purpose of
                an HTTP connection manager is to serve as a factory for new HTTP connections,
                to manage life cycle of persistent connections and to synchronize access to
                persistent connections making sure that only one thread can have access
                to a connection at a time. Internally HTTP connection managers work with instances
                of <code class="interfacename">ManagedHttpClientConnection</code> acting as a proxy
                for a real connection that manages connection state and controls execution
                of I/O operations. If a managed connection is released or get explicitly closed
                by its consumer the underlying connection gets detached from its proxy and is
                returned back to the manager. Even though the service consumer still holds
                a reference to the proxy instance, it is no longer able to execute any
                I/O operations or change the state of the real connection either intentionally
                or unintentionally.</p>
            <p>This is an example of acquiring a connection from a connection manager:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
HttpClientContext context = HttpClientContext.create();
HttpClientConnectionManager connMrg = new BasicHttpClientConnectionManager();
HttpRoute route = new HttpRoute(new HttpHost("localhost", 80));
// Request new connection. This can be a long process
ConnectionRequest connRequest = connMrg.requestConnection(route, null);
// Wait for connection up to 10 sec
HttpClientConnection conn = connRequest.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
try {
    // If not open
    if (!conn.isOpen()) {
        // establish connection based on its route info
        connMrg.connect(conn, route, 1000, context);
        // and mark it as route complete
        connMrg.routeComplete(conn, route, context);
    }
    // Do useful things with the connection.
} finally {
    connMrg.releaseConnection(conn, null, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
}
</pre>
            <p>The connection request can be terminated prematurely by calling
                <code class="methodname">ConnectionRequest#cancel()</code> if necessary. This will unblock
                the thread blocked in the <code class="methodname">ConnectionRequest#get()</code>
                method.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" title="2.3.2.&nbsp;Simple connection manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e373"></a>2.3.2.&nbsp;Simple connection manager</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p><code class="classname">BasicHttpClientConnectionManager</code> is a simple connection
                manager that maintains only one connection at a time. Even though this class
                is thread-safe it ought to be used by one execution thread only.
                <code class="classname">BasicHttpClientConnectionManager</code> will make an effort to reuse
                the connection for subsequent requests with the same route. It will, however, close 
                the existing connection and re-open it for the given route, if the route of the 
                persistent connection does not match that of the connection request. 
                If the connection has been already been allocated, then <code class="exceptionname">
                java.lang.IllegalStateException</code> is thrown.</p>
            <p>This connection manager implementation should be used inside an EJB
                container.</p>

        <div class="section" title="2.3.3.&nbsp;Pooling connection manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e380"></a>2.3.3.&nbsp;Pooling connection manager</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p><code class="classname">PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager</code> is a more complex
                implementation that manages a pool of client connections and is able to service
                connection requests from multiple execution threads. Connections are pooled on a per
                route basis. A request for a route for which the manager already has a persistent
                connection available in the pool will be serviced by leasing a connection from
                the pool rather than creating a brand new connection.</p>
            <p><code class="classname">PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager</code> maintains a maximum
                limit of connections on a per route basis and in total. Per default this
                implementation will create no more than 2 concurrent connections per given route
                and no more 20 connections in total. For many real-world applications these limits
                may prove too constraining, especially if they use HTTP as a transport protocol for
                their services.</p>
            <p>This example shows how the connection pool parameters can be adjusted:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager cm = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();
// Increase max total connection to 200
cm.setMaxTotal(200);
// Increase default max connection per route to 20
cm.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(20);
// Increase max connections for localhost:80 to 50
HttpHost localhost = new HttpHost("locahost", 80);
cm.setMaxPerRoute(new HttpRoute(localhost), 50);

CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom()
        .setConnectionManager(cm)

            <p>When an HttpClient instance is no longer needed and is about to go out of scope it
                is important to shut down its connection manager to ensure that all connections kept
                alive by the manager get closed and system resources allocated by those connections
                are released.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = &lt;...&gt;
httpClient.close();

        <p>When equipped with a pooling connection manager such as <code class="classname">
            PoolingClientConnectionManager</code>, HttpClient can be used to execute multiple 
            requests simultaneously using multiple threads of execution.</p>
        <p>The <code class="classname">PoolingClientConnectionManager</code> will allocate connections 
            based on its configuration. If all connections for a given route have already been 
            leased, a request for a connection will block until a connection is released back to 
            the pool. One can ensure the connection manager does not block indefinitely in the 
            connection request operation by setting <code class="literal">'http.conn-manager.timeout'</code> 
            to a positive value. If the connection request cannot be serviced within the given time 
            period <code class="exceptionname">ConnectionPoolTimeoutException</code> will be thrown.

        <p>One of the major shortcomings of the classic blocking I/O model is that the network
            socket can react to I/O events only when blocked in an I/O operation. When a connection
            is released back to the manager, it can be kept alive however it is unable to monitor
            the status of the socket and react to any I/O events. If the connection gets closed on
            the server side, the client side connection is unable to detect the change in the
            connection state (and react appropriately by closing the socket on its end).</p>
        <p>HttpClient tries to mitigate the problem by testing whether the connection is 'stale',
            that is no longer valid because it was closed on the server side, prior to using the
            connection for executing an HTTP request. The stale connection check is not 100%
            reliable and adds 10 to 30 ms overhead to each request execution. The only feasible
            solution that does not involve a one thread per socket model for idle connections is a
            dedicated monitor thread used to evict connections that are considered expired due to a
            long period of inactivity. The monitor thread can periodically call
                <code class="methodname">ClientConnectionManager#closeExpiredConnections()</code> method to
            close all expired connections and evict closed connections from the pool. It can also
            optionally call <code class="methodname">ClientConnectionManager#closeIdleConnections()</code>

        <p>The HTTP specification does not specify how long a persistent connection may be and
            should be kept alive. Some HTTP servers use a non-standard <code class="literal">Keep-Alive</code>
            header to communicate to the client the period of time in seconds they intend to keep
            the connection alive on the server side. HttpClient makes use of this information if
            available. If the <code class="literal">Keep-Alive</code> header is not present in the response,
            HttpClient assumes the connection can be kept alive indefinitely. However, many HTTP
            servers in general use are configured to drop persistent connections after a certain period
            of inactivity in order to conserve system resources, quite often without informing the
            client. In case the default strategy turns out to be too optimistic, one may want to

        <p>HTTP connections make use of a <code class="classname">java.net.Socket</code> object
            internally to handle transmission of data across the wire. However they rely on
            the <code class="interfacename">ConnectionSocketFactory</code> interface to create,
            initialize and connect sockets. This enables the users of HttpClient to provide
            application specific socket initialization code at runtime. <code class="classname">
                PlainConnectionSocketFactory</code> is the default factory for creating and
            initializing plain (unencrypted) sockets.</p>
        <p>The process of creating a socket and that of connecting it to a host are decoupled, so
            that the socket could be closed while being blocked in the connect operation.</p>

            <p><code class="interfacename">LayeredConnectionSocketFactory</code> is an extension of
                the <code class="interfacename">ConnectionSocketFactory</code> interface. Layered socket
                factories are capable of creating sockets layered over an existing plain socket.
                Socket layering is used primarily for creating secure sockets through proxies.
                HttpClient ships with <code class="classname">SSLSocketFactory</code> that implements
                SSL/TLS layering. Please note HttpClient does not use any custom encryption
                functionality. It is fully reliant on standard Java Cryptography (JCE) and Secure
                Sockets (JSEE) extensions.</p>

                <code class="classname">SSLSocketFactory</code> allows for a high degree of
                customization. It can take an instance of
                <code class="interfacename">javax.net.ssl.SSLContext</code> as a parameter and use
                it to create custom configured SSL connections.</p>

            <p>In addition to the trust verification and the client authentication performed on
                the SSL/TLS protocol level, HttpClient can optionally verify whether the target
                hostname matches the names stored inside the server's X.509 certificate, once the
                connection has been established. This verification can provide additional guarantees
                of authenticity of the server trust material.
                The <code class="interfacename">X509HostnameVerifier</code> interface
                represents a strategy for hostname verification. HttpClient ships with three
                <code class="interfacename">X509HostnameVerifier</code> implementations.
                Important: hostname verification should not be confused with
                SSL trust verification.</p>

                        The strict hostname verifier works the same way as Sun Java 1.4, Sun
                            Java 5, Sun Java 6. It's also pretty close to IE6. This implementation
                            appears to be compliant with RFC 2818 for dealing with wildcards. The
                            hostname must match either the first CN, or any of the subject-alts. A
                            wildcard can occur in the CN, and in any of the subject-alts.

                        This hostname verifier that works the same way as Curl and Firefox. The

                            and <code class="classname">StrictHostnameVerifier</code> is that a wildcard
                            (such as "*.foo.com") with
                            <code class="classname">BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier</code> matches all

                        This hostname verifier essentially turns hostname verification off.
                            This implementation is a no-op, and never throws

        <p>Even though HttpClient is aware of complex routing scemes and proxy chaining, it
            supports only simple direct or one hop proxy connections out of the box.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to tell HttpClient to connect to the target host via a proxy is by
            setting the default proxy parameter:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost("someproxy", 8080);
DefaultProxyRoutePlanner routePlanner = new DefaultProxyRoutePlanner(proxy);
CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()
        .setRoutePlanner(routePlanner)
        .build();
</pre>
        <p>One can also instruct HttpClient to use the standard JRE proxy selector to obtain proxy
            information:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
SystemDefaultRoutePlanner routePlanner = new SystemDefaultRoutePlanner(
        ProxySelector.getDefault());
CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()
        .setRoutePlanner(routePlanner)
        .build();
</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, one can provide a custom <code class="interfacename">RoutePlanner</code>
            implementation in order to have a complete control over the process of HTTP route
            computation:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
HttpRoutePlanner routePlanner = new HttpRoutePlanner() {

    public HttpRoute determineRoute(
            HttpHost target,
            HttpRequest request,
            HttpContext context) throws HttpException {
        return new HttpRoute(target, null,  new HttpHost("someproxy", 8080),
                "https".equalsIgnoreCase(target.getSchemeName()));
    }

};
CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()
